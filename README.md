# PythonProjects
Some things I've done in python. Not all are Cyber Security

Hangman.py is a simple Hangman game. See how good you can do!

portscanner.py is a simple port scanner with scapy tools to list all open ports on the WAN

arpspoof.py is a ARP spoofer that I built for a Cyber Security Project

packSniff.py is a simple packet sniffer that will return any packets over the given IP address. 

caesar.py is a caesar hash used for any password given to it. I might add a argument in the future to change the offset used for the hash

FarmBot/ is a Automatic Farming bot used for AlbionOnline. (Work in Progress)
