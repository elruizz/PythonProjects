Some things I've done in python. Not all are Cyber Security

Hangman.py is a simple Hangman game. See how good you can do!

portscanner.py is a simple port scanner with scapy tools to list all open ports on the WAN

caesar.py is a caesar hash used for any password given to it. I might add a argument in the future to change the offset used for the hash
